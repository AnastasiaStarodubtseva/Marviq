# Marviq Interview challenge

This page includes Assignment A and Assignment B. I did not find the time to complete Assignment C.

I wrote most of the HTML in the JavaScript file. I did this because I don't know how many machines will be in the data. In case you want to display more machines, instead of writing more HTML for each machine, you can just add those machines to the data.

The most unexpected was the blocking of the server in Russia on which there were all data for writing this work. I moved the data to GitHub to work around the block.

I enjoyed working on this task, and it was a good opportunity to learn more JavaScript and jQuery.
